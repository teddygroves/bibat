===================================
Welcome to bibat's documentation!
===================================

Bibat is an interactive template for Bayesian statistical analysis projects that
uses `cookiecutter <https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, `Stan
<https://mc-stan.org/>`_, `cmdstanpy <https://cmdstanpy.readthedocs.io/>`_ and
`arviz <https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/>`_. It takes a 'batteries-included'
approach, creating a whole working project rather than a skeleton.

The :ref:`getting started <getting_started>` page has the information you need
in order to install bibat it and then using it to create a folder containing a
complete example Bayesian statistical analysis project. It also describes
bibat's :ref:`dependencies <dependencies>`.

The next thing you will probably want to do is learn how to turn the example
analysis into the analysis you actually want to do. For this there is the
:ref:`working with bibat <working_with_bibat>` page.

For reference information about bibat, check out the :ref:`cli` and :ref:`api`
pages.

If you would like to contribute to bibat in any way---please do!---the
:ref:`contributing` page has some useful information.

Finally, see the :ref:`accessibility` page to find out how we have tried to
make this website as useable as possible for everyone, and for how to
