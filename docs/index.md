Bibat is an interactive template for Bayesian statistical analysis projects.

The [getting started](getting_started.md) page has the information you need
in order to install bibat it and then use it to create a complete example
Bayesian statistical analysis project. It also describes bibat's
[dependencies](getting_started.md#dependencies).

The next thing you will probably want to do is learn how to turn the example
analysis into the analysis you actually want to do. For this there is the
[working with bibat](working_with_bibat.md) page and [this vignette](_static/
report.html) describing a bibat-based analysis of some sports data.

For reference information about bibat, check out the [api](api.md) page.

If you would like to contribute to bibat in any way, the [contributing](contributing.md) page has some useful information.

Finally, see the [accessibility](accessibility.md) page to find out how we have
tried to make this website as useable as possible for everyone.
