Bibat is an interactive template for Bayesian statistical analysis projects.

The [getting started](getting_started.md) page explains how to create a
complete example analysis using bibat.

Next, you will probably want to learn how to turn the example analysis into the
analysis you actually want to do. For this there are the [working with bibat](working_with_bibat.md) page and [vignettes](vignettes.md) pages.

For reference information, check out the [api](api.md) page.

If you would like to contribute to bibat, the [contributing](contributing.md)
page has some useful information.

See the [accessibility](accessibility.md) page for how we try to make bibat as
useable as possible for everyone.
