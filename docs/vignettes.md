[This vignette](_static/report.html) provides a step by step description of
how to create a complex analysis of baseball data starting with bibat's example
project. You can see the complete analysis [here](https://github.com/teddygroves/bibat/tree/main/bibat/example_projects/baseball). This is
probably the most useful example project as it is kept up to date as bibat is
developed.

For even more inspiration, check out these projects that used bibat:

- [mrna](https://github.com/teddygroves/mrna) A published analysis of mRNA
  regulation, made fully Bayesian and then improved.
- [putting](https://github.com/teddygroves/putting) A Bayesian analysis of putting data
- [km-stats](https://github.com/biosustain/km-stats) Statistical analysis of
  Michaelis constant measurements from online databases
* [biothermostat](https://github.com/biosustain/biothermostat) Statistical
  analysis of biochemical thermodynamics data.

If you used bibat to start your analysis, feel free to [add it to this list](https://github.com/teddygroves/bibat/blob/main/docs/vignettes.md)!
