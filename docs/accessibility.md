# Accessibility

The bibat developers want as many people as possible to be able to use this
website. For example, that means you should be able to:

- change colours, contrast levels and fonts

- zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen

- navigate most of the website using just a keyboard

- navigate most of the website using speech recognition software

- listen to most of the website using a screen reader

- We’ve also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.
