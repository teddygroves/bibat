    Your project "{{ project_name }}" has been created successfully!

    Next steps:

    1. Change directory to the project root:

       $ cd {{ _copier_conf.dst_path }}

    2. Run the example analysis:

       $ make analysis

    3. Edit the example analysis so that it implements your desired Bayesian workflow. If you'd like to read more about how to do this, check out this
    documentation page: https://bibat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/working_with_bibat.html
