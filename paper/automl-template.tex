\section*{Submission Checklist}

% All submissions must include a section containing the AutoML submission
% checklist, shown below. The submission checklist does not count towards the
% page limit and must be included at submission and camera-ready time.  The
% submission checklist draws upon related submission checklists:
%
% the NeurIPS '22 checklist: https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2022/PaperInformation/PaperChecklist
%     and the NAS checklist: https://www.automl.org/wp-content/uploads/NAS/NAS_checklist.pdf
%
% For each question, change the default \answerTODO{} to either:
%
%     \answerYes{[justification]},
%     \answerNo{[justification]}, or
%     \answerNA{[justification]}.

% *You must include a brief justification to your answer,} either by referencing
% *the appropriate section of your paper or providing a brief inline
% *description.* For example:
%
% -  Did you include the license of the code and datasets?
%
%    \answerYes{See Section~\ref{sec:code}.
%
% - Did you include all the code for running experiments?
%
%   \answerNo{We include the code we wrote for conducting the experiments, but
%   complete replication depends on proprietary libraries for executing on a
%   private compute cluster. The code therefore is not runnable without
%   modification. To compensate, we provide a runnable but non-parallelized
%   version of the code that could replicate the results at the expense of a
%   greater wall-clock time.}
%
% - Did you include the license of the datasets?
%
%   \answerNA{Our experiments were conducted on publicly available datasets and
%   we have not introduced new datasets.}
%
% Please note that if you answer a question with \verb|\answerNo{}|, we expect
% that you provide an explanation and/or compensation for the omission. For
% example, if you cannot provide complete evaluation code for some reason, you
% might instead provide code for a minimal reproduction of the main insights of
% your paper.
%
% Please do not modify the questions and only use the provided macros for your
% answers. Note that the submission checklist does not count towards the page
% limit.

    %
  \item Did you include the raw results of running your experiments with the given

  \item Did you include the code, additional data, and instructions needed to generate
    the figures and tables in your paper based on the raw results?
